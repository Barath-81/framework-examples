  Spreadsheet Components
  ======================

  Headers: A row or column of descriptions. This cell range abuts
  the data cells and usually corresponds to the function or method being
  called, with the data being parameters or attributes. Headers can also be
  preceded with an asterisk(*) if you wish to indicate which headers
  are required information. These asterisks are automatically removed
  when the spreadsheet is read.
  [Style = Bold, Cell Shaded]

  Data: The data should comprise the bulk of information on the spreadsheet
  and represents the parameters used for the function or testcase (which we
  get from the header cells).
  [Style = None]

  Comments: Any text in shaded cells along the top or left of the spreadsheet.
  You can have as many rows or columns of comments as you like, presuming
  all of the other rules are followed.
  [Style = Bold, Cell Shaded]

  Valid Data Configurations
  =========================

  This library has a few requirements about the format of the
  worksheet data so it can be properly parsed. For the sake of example,
  cells that are shaded are bordered by '.', 'H' represents Header cells and
  'd' represents data. Any shaded cell that is blank could be used for comments.

  This is the simplest way to format the data with a single
  row or column of header cells (shaded) with data

  + . +---+---+    + . + . + . +
  . H | d | d |    . H . H . H .
  + . +---+---+    +---+---+---+
  . H | d | d |    | d | d | d |
  + . +---+---+    +---+---+---+
  | H | d | d |    | d | d | d |
  + . +---+---+    +---+---+---+

  You can also add additional shaded columns to the top and
  left to make room for any comments that may be helpful

  + . + . + . + . +    + . + . + . + . +
  .   .   .   .   .    .   . H . H . H .
  + . + . +---+---+    + . +---+---+---+
  .   . H | d | d |    .   | d | d | d |
  + . + . +---+---+    + . +---+---+---+
  .   | H | d | d |    .   | d | d | d |
  + . + . +---+---+    + . +---+---+---+

  The library will inspect the worksheet and determine the first
  data cell (upper left) by looking for the first non-shaded
  cell. The last datacell (lower right) will be used with that first
  data cell to form a rectangle representing the boundaries of the
  test data. Then, the cells to the left and top of the first data
  cell will be looked at to see if the text in the cell is bolded.
  If so, it's assumed to be the header row.

  Skipping Data
  =============

  The following items will be skipped and not parsed. This gives an
  easy way to disable data

  - Spreadsheet tabs that are colored (right click the tab and change the
  Tab Color)
  - Spreadsheet tabs that START with a comment (using #).
  - Spreadsheet rows that are italicized

  Note that you CAN have comments in a tab and the comment portion
  will be stripped before it's used. This is actually useful because
  it works around Excel's requirement that every tab name is unique.
  So for example you could have MyTab#a, MyTab#b as separate tabs in
  the spreadsheet and MyTab will be returned by Book.each. (though
  you do need to specify the full tabname with the comment when using
  the :continue option)

  Bookmarks
  ==========

  There are a few features around continuing from a bookmark or a given
  point in the spreadsheet. This is accomplished with the :continue option.

  While the spreadsheet is parsed, a bookmark is dropped before each row/col
  of data is read. This bookmark is stored in the '.bookmarks' file and is
  unique for each spreadsheet run in that directory. If for some reason the
  script execution is interrupted or the script aborts unexpectedly, you can
  simply pick up where you left off by using :continue =&gt; true.

  Further you have much more control and can specify a specific tab to start
  from and even a row/col (depending on the spreadsheet format). This follows
  the format :continue =&gt; TabName[row/col]. So you could do any of the
  following: MyTab, MyTab[F], MyOtherTab[10] and the lib will not start returning
  any spreadsheet data till that location is found.

  You can also specify a maximum number of pages to process when you're
  continuing using the :pagecount =&gt; [number]. In conjunction with :continue,
  this allows you to run exactly one tab if you like. Without :pagecount, the
  spreadsheet will be read from the continuation point till the end of the
  workbook.

  Example
  =======

  OPTIONS =
  :visible          Make the Excel Spreadsheet visible when processing
  :continue         Continue from a bookmark
  :pagecount        Continue for n pages after a bookmark

  book = Spreadsheet::Book.new(spreadsheet, { :visible =&gt; true })
  book.each do |sheet|
    puts '---' + sheet.name + '---'
    puts sheet.to_s
    sheet.each do |record|
      record.each do |cell|
         puts &quot;\t#{cell.header}=#{cell.value}&quot;
      end
    end
  end

  TODO:
  Handle true/false, numbers so we're not passing in the string
  Work out how to handle verification - maybe using tab have a static method?
